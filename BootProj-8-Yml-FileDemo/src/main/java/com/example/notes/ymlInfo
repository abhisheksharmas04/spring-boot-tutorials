YML/YAML:
	-> Yet another Markup Language.
	-> YAMLing Language
	-> Yaint Markup Language
	-> The file can have either .yml or yaml extension.
	
	-> The biggest limitation of properties file is the node level will be repeated in multiple keys.. especially while working with common prefix.

	-> As of now only spring boot is supporting yml spring is not supporting yml.

	-> application.properties
	-------------------------
		emp.info.name=raja
		emp.info.id=1001
		emp.info.location=jpr
	-> application.yml:
	----------------------
		emp:
		   info:
		      name: raja
			  id: 1001
			  location: jpr
	-> Spring boot application internally convert every yml content to properties content before it uses it.
	-> To convert yml content to properties content and to parse, process yml documents spring boot internally uses snakeyml api.

	-> While writing yml file "." should be replace with:
		(1) same nodes/level in the kye should not be repreated.
		(2) replace "." of each node/level with semicolon(;) and write new node in the next line having proper indentation.
		(3) replace "=" with ":" before placing value
		(4) to place arraylist/list/set elememnts use "-" symbol
		(5) take map collections keys and has a properties sub keys as the new nodes.
    
    -> Q-> If we place both properties and yml file haveing same keys and different value can u tell me what happens?
    -> ans-> The value given application.properties will override the value given in application.yml
